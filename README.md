# WIP
Currently not working and project is very messy. Should be cleaned up and working soon.

# Dota 2 Layout Handler (WIP)
An easy way to transfer Dota 2 Layouts (post 2019 Summer Scrub update)

TODO: Add screenshot of program

The default location of the layout file should be `C:/Program Files/Steam/userdata/*YOURUSERID*/570/remote/cfg/hero_grid_config.json`

Program will automatically backup files prior to modifications

# Building
jsoncpp is included using hunter while Qt isn't.\
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH reflects my personal Qt path. It can be modified or deleted based on your personal setup.
